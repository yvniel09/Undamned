### When i started studying software development in the technical school i didn't think some day i would had to build a game and not even to think in a virtual reality game. 
### So we put so much effort with this project, we created it for the Electronic Day Technological Expo at Instituto TÃ©cnico Salesiano and it was a totally success, everyone love it!
