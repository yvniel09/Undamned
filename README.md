This is one of my most beloved projects. It was the first game I built, showcased, and promoted. Not only did we build a game â€” we realized a dream we had since we were kids. We collaborated extensively to create this, and to this day, it remains one of our projects with the most potential. This project opened many doors for us in the software development field â€” we were even invited to join the [Dominican Republic National Game Development Association](https://addv.do/).

### When i started studying software development in the technical school i didn't think some day i would had to build a game and not even to think in a virtual reality game. 
### So we put so much effort with this project, we created it for the Electronic Day Technological Expo at Instituto TÃ©cnico Salesiano and it was a totally success, everyone love it!
